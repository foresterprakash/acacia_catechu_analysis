# Background

## Introduction

*Acacia catechu* is a primary tree species from *fabaceae*
family[@acaciaca] . It is commonly known as *khair* is a multipurpose
medium sized tree species primarily found forest with tropical dry and
tropical moist condition [@champion_revised_1968]. Nepal is one of the
native habitat of the species along with India, Pakistan and Thailand.
It is also found in Indonesia, Kenya and Mozambique as an exotic
species. It is associated with *Bombax ceiba, Butea monosperma*, and
*Dalbergia sisoo*[@bhattarai2020]. In Nepal, it is widely distributed in
Terai, the plain area, and elevated upto 900m above the sea level.
Primarily it is regarded as riverine forest of Terai, dun areas and
extended to some gravelly river beds and also found in bed pd Seti River
near Pokhara. It grows naturally as well as it can be grown artificially
by seed, later it grows as a strong light demanding tree with
characteristic of highly resistant to the drought [@jackson1994].

It is not only valuable species from the medicinal or commercial point
of view but also a valuable timber species known for its strong and
durable wood, which has been widely used in construction, furniture
making, and traditional medicine. The tree is considered important in
both ecological and socio-economical terms [@bhattarai2020]. Most
important and commercial product from *A.catechu* are katha and cutch,
and there are several factories producing katha in Nepal, the end
product of which is exported to India [@bhattarai2020]. The product like
food, fodder, fuel timber, tannin or dyestuff, gum or resin, poison,
medicine as well the barrier or support, with the help of its brushwood
fence, service is provided by the species [@acaciac].

Besides this *A.catechu* has a significant medicinal uses. *A. catechu*
is being used traditionally to cure some of the diseases, like
gastrointestinal and stomach related problems, leprosy and few skin
diseases [@kumar2019; @kunwar2010; @thangavelu2020]. *A. catechu*Â is
rich in phytochemicals with diverse pharmaceutical and biological
activities in its different components of woods i.e., sapwood and
heartwood [@adhikari2021].

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Anatomy of tree trunk"}
knitr::include_graphics("tree_trunk.png", )
```

The xylem of the most species has two physiologically different zone
called the sapwood and heartwood. The outer layer i.e., sapwood contains
physiologically active living cells and nutrient materials whereas the
heartwood as inner dark layer is physiologically inactive zone with
strong foundation to the wood [@ayobi2011]. The heartwood of *A.catechu*
contains tannins, terpenoides, triterpenoids, carbohydrates etc.
[@adhikari2021] whereas the sapwood of khair posses the great importance
in the growth of the tree. Commercially, heartwood is more important
because of its richness in chemicals and its medicinal value.

This study aims to emphasizes the quantification of the heartwood volume
and sapwood volume in respect to the diameter of the logs. The study
provides the heartwood and sapwood ratio to the log volume and its
correlation with the diameter of the log. The result in this study
provides the comprehensive idea to quantify the amount of heartwood and
sapwood without chopping it.

## Objectives

The objective of this study is to assess the ratio of sapwood and
heartwood in *A. catechu* trees across the Bagmati Province. The study
excels the understanding of the proportion of sapwood and heartwood in
different diameter class of the tree logs.

The specific objectives of this study are as follows:

1.  To quantify and analyze the ratio of sapwood and heartwood in
    *Acacia catechu* trees in the Bagmati Province of Nepal.

2.  To examine the variations in sapwood and heartwood proportions
    across different age classes of *Acacia catechu*.

3.  To compare the ratio of the wood component in Terai and Mid-hill Region

## Significance of the Study

The findings of this study hold several implications for the management
and utilization of Acacia catechu in the Bagmati Province. To begin with
the knowledge gained regarding the ratio of sapwood and heartwood can
contribute to improved tree age determination for the harvesting of the
species which further improves the economic benefit to all stakeholders.

In addition to that, understanding the variations in sapwood and
heartwood proportions across different age classes of *Acacia catechu*
can assist in sustainable harvesting strategies. By targeting trees with
optimal heartwood development, it is possible to maximize timber quality
and minimize waste in the processing industry.

Conclusively, the findings of this study can contribute to the
scientific knowledge of *Acacia catechu* in the context of the Bagmati
Province. It fills a research gap and provides a basis for further
investigations and studies related to the species' ecology, physiology,
wood properties and business.

# Methodology

## Secondary source of Knowledge

Several researches on *Acacia catechu* as a riverine forest species were
taken into consideration during the before and during the field work
which provided comprehensive guide throughout the process. Several
national and international publication were extensively reviewed
throughout the study period.Forest research and Training center,
Ministry of forest and environment, Bagmati province and other
organizations were the major source of literature and suggestion. Those
sources were highly acclaimed by the research team.

## Access to the log samples

Bagmati province is one of the most prime province in Nepal in terms of
the variablity in forest types. There are sufficient amount of river
systems which is potential habitat for *acacia catechu* forests. Several
districts like Dhading, Chitwan,Nuwakot, Makawanpur, Sindhuli,
Sindhupalchok, Kabhrepalachok, etc. are connected with river systems
with subtropical climatic conditions. Forest Research Training Center as
a client and the organization as a consulting organization jointly made
an effort to coordinate with Division Forest Offices to find an desired
sample logs for the study. With continued discussion five divisions were
chosen as a study site i.e., Chitwan, Dhading, Kabhrepalachok, Sindhuli
and Marin Division forest offices. Maximum possible number of sample
logs were taken in the designed division forest offices.

## Data Collection

With all available logs following parameters were taken.

-   Under bark girth of the log in both thick and thin end of the log in
    centimeters.

-   Under bark girth of the log in the mid section of the log in
    centimeters.

-   Girth are converted into diameter using the formula dividing them by
    $\pi$ .

-   Length of the log in meters.

-   Thickness of the sapwood in cm. ( This measurement is taken in two
    direction in each end of the log. The final thickness is the average
    of those four measurements.

-   Diameter of the heartwood in both ends of the logs in centimeters.

## Data Analysis

Microsoft Statistical package R is used to analyse the data.

### Volume of the Log

The volume of the log was calculated using the
$smalian's\space formula$. Which is the average of the cross sectional
area in each end of the log multiplied by the length of the log. Then
mathematical representation of $smalian's\space formula$ is as follows:

$$
V = \frac{{S1 + S2}}{2} * L\tag{i}
$$

Where $$
S_1 = \frac{{\pi\space * \space d_1^2}} {4}\tag{ii}
$$

$S_1$ as a Basal area in one end of the log. Similarly the $S_2$ is the
basal area of another end calculated using same formula with the $d_2$
diameter of the second end.

and $L$ is the length of the log from thick end to the thick end.

This formula gives the volume of the whole log. which contains both sap
wood and heartwood.

### Volume of the Heartwood

As mentioned before, the diameter of the heartwood was measured in both
of the ends of the logs. Clear indication of heartwood was judged by the
data collector and other forestry officials in the field.

Volume of the heartwood was also calculated using the equation $(i)$.
$Smalian's \space Formula$ is used to calculate the volume because the
diameter of the heartwood at the middle part of the log is impossible.
Hence both log volume and heartwood volume is calculated using
$smalian's \space Formula$.

### Volume of the Sapwood

The volume of the sapwood is calculated using: $$
V_{Sapwood} = V_{Log} - V_{Heartwood}\tag{iii}
$$

### Wood Component Ratios

Three ratios is calculated and displayed in the results. **First** is
the ratio between the heartwood and total log volume without bark,
**Second** the ration between the sapwood volume and the volume of log
and **Third one** is the ration of sapwood volume to the heartwood
volume.

1.  Heartwood ratio to the log volume $$
    Ratio_{(HW/Log)} = \frac{Volume_{(Heartwood)}}{Volume_{(Log)}}\tag{iv}
    $$

2.  Sapwood ratio to the log volume $$
    Ratio_{(SW/Log)} = \frac{Volume_{(Sapwood)}}{Volume_{(Log)}}\tag{v}
    $$

3.  Sapwood ratio to the heartwood volume $$
    Ratio_{(SW/HW)} = \frac{Volume_{(Sapwood)}}{Volume_{(Heartwood)}}\tag{vi}
    $$

### Normality test of the data

To test the normality of the ratio, the most common method called
Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was used.The Shapiro-Wilk test is a
statistical test used to assess the normality of a dataset. It is widely
used to determine whether a sample of data comes from a population that
follows a normal distribution. The test is based on the idea that if the
data is normally distributed, the expected order statistics (ranked
values) will follow a specific pattern.The test calculates the test
statistic (W) based on the correlation between the observed data and the
expected normal order statistics. The test statistic ranges between 0
and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better conformity to a normal
distribution.

The Shapiro-Wilk test also provides a p-value, which represents the
probability of obtaining the observed test statistic (or a more extreme
value) assuming that the data is normally distributed. A small p-value
suggests that the data significantly deviates from normality.It's
important to note that the Shapiro-Wilk test is more accurate and
powerful for small to moderate sample sizes compared to other normality
tests like the Anderson-Darling or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

### Variance of the ratio of sapwood to heartwood

To test the variance of the heartwood sapwood ratio in different
diameter classes,Levene's test was used which is a common test used to
assess the equality of variances across multiple groups.Levene's test is
a statistical test used to assess the equality of variances between
multiple groups or samples. It is particularly useful when the
assumption of equal variances is violated. The test calculates a test
statistic based on the absolute deviations between each observation and
the group mean, and it compares this statistic to a critical value from
the F-distribution. If the test statistic is significantly different
from the critical value, it suggests that there is a significant
difference in variances among the groups.

### Choosing the statistical test.

Based on the normality, variance among the groups and number samples
among the groups will determine the statistical test. To choose the
suitable statistical tests for testing the difference in mean and
median, more information about specific data and the nature of the
variables is needed. *Sample Size:* Consider the size of your sample.
Larger sample sizes tend to provide more reliable estimates of
population parameters and increase the power of statistical tests.

*Distribution:* Assess the distributional characteristics of your data.
Determine whether the data follows a normal distribution or if it
exhibits skewness or heavy-tailed behavior. This can guide the selection
of appropriate statistical tests.

*Suitable Statistical Tests:*

Difference in Mean: If your data follows a normal distribution and you
want to compare the means of two or more groups, you can use parametric
tests such as the independent t-test (for two groups) or analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc tests (for more than two groups).
If the data does not follow a normal distribution or the assumptions for
parametric tests are violated, you can consider non-parametric
alternatives like the Mann-Whitney U test (for two groups) or the
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc tests (for more than two
groups).

Difference in Median: If your data does not follow a normal distribution
and you want to compare the medians of two or more groups,
non-parametric tests are typically used. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test
(also known as the Mann-Whitney U test) can be employed for comparing
two groups, while the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc tests is
suitable for comparing multiple groups. These tests assess whether there
are statistically significant differences in the medians across the
groups.

# Results

## Preview of the data From field

Primarily dimensions like girth of log, sapwood thickness and heartwood
diameter was collected from the field. After transferring to the digital
format in excel sheet the data looked like as the table below:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the library and data 
library(RcmdrMisc)
#library(kableExtra)
dat <- readXL("E:/Acacia_data/V2/Field final Data.xlsx",sheet = 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sum_tab <- dat %>%
  group_by(remarks) %>%
  slice_sample(n=7)
knitr::kable(sum_tab, caption = "A Summary of field data", align = 'l')
```

*Note : All the measurements were taken in centimeters (cm)*

```{r, echo = FALSE,, results= TRUE}
# Data analysis process here.
# For log diameter - convert girth to diameter (division by pi)
dat$dia_log1 <- dat$girth1/pi
dat$dia_logm <- dat$girth_m/pi
dat$dia_log2 <- dat$girth3/pi

# define the diameter as 0-30, 30-50 and 50 above
dat$dia_class <- ifelse(dat$dia_logm <30,"0-30",
                        ifelse(dat$dia_logm <50, "30-50","50 above"))
# For basal areas of the log
dat$ba_log1 <- (pi * dat$dia_log1^2)/4
dat$ba_log_2 <- (pi * dat$dia_log2^2)/4

# Now log Volume using Equation 1

\newpage

## Summary of the preliminary results

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}

dat_sum <- data.frame(
  Var_names <- c("Min", "Mean", "Median", "Max", "STDEV"),
  Log_diameter = c(min(dat$dia_logm),
          mean(dat$dia_logm),
          median(dat$dia_logm),
          max(dat$dia_logm),
          sd(dat$dia_logm)),
  Heartwood_diameter = c(min(dat$hw_dia),
          mean(dat$hw_dia),
          median(dat$hw_dia),
          max(dat$hw_dia),
          sd(dat$hw_dia))
)
colnames(dat_sum) <- c(" ","Log Diameter(cm)", "Heartwood diameter (cm)")
```

The diameter of the log and diameter of the heartwood ranges from
`r round(min(dat$dia_logm),2)` cm and `r round(min(dat$hw_dia),2)` cm
and to `r round(max(dat$dia_logm),2)` cm and
`r round(min(dat$hw_dia),2)` cm respectively. As described in the table
below mean diameters of the log and heartwood are
`r round(mean(dat$dia_logm),2)` cm and `r round(mean(dat$hw_dia),2)` cm
respectively. This means the overall log diameter is lesser in size.
This might be the because of the availability of the sample. The fig
below further represents the overall distribution of the diameter data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}
knitr:: kable(dat_sum, caption = "Summary of the log dimensions", digits = 2)
```

```{r fig.cap= "Distribution of diameter", fig.align='center'}
boxplot(dat$dia_logm,dat$hw_dia, ylab = "Diameter in cm", names = c("Log", "Heartwood"), col = "yellow")
      
```

The figure suggests the overall distribution of the diameters are
between 20 cm to 30 cm. Very less numbers of the log sample are taken
from the diameter class above 50 cm.

## Diameter class division

With the information above total number of logs are divided into three
diameter classes i.e., 0 - 30cm in diameter, 30-50 cm in diameter, and
logs with diameter above 50 cm. Lesser representation of sample logs
with higher diameter class can be regarded as the limitation of the
sampling techniques.

```{r, echo= FALSE, results= TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
d <- dat %>%
  group_by(dia_class) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = round(mean(dia_logm),2), mean_R = round(mean(ratio_hw_log),2), mean_S = round(mean(ratio_sw_log),2))
colnames(d) <- c("Diameter(cm)", "Number of logs", "Mean diameter", "Mean ratio (HW to Log volume)", "Mean ratio (SW to Log Volume)")
knitr::kable(d, caption = "Number of logs in different diameter classes")
```

```{r, fig.cap= "Relation of the diameter and heartwood ratio", warning= FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = dia_logm , y = ratio_hw_log)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth( se = F, method = "lm") + labs(x = "Log Diameter (cm)", y = "Ratio of Heartwood to the Log volume") + facet_wrap(~remarks, scale = "free")
```

The table simply displays the increase in ratio of heartwood volume to
the log volume. The fig possess the agreement with the data but there is
unclear pattern of data distribution. This can explain the relation of
diameter and the ratio of heartwood in a complex way So that it is
difficult to predict the ratio of heartwood volume to the total log
volume by the diameter of log. The later figure in this part displays
the inverse relation between diameter to the ratio of sapwood volume
which is as predicted after looking into its relation to the heartwood
volume. \newpage

```{r, fig.cap= "Relation of the diameter and sapwood ratio", warning= FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = dia_logm , y = ratio_sw_log)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth( se = F, method = "lm") + labs(x = "Log Diameter (cm)", y = "Ratio of Heartwood to the Log volume") + facet_wrap(~remarks, scale = "free")

```

## Ratio of sapwood volume to heartwood

There were visible increase of heartwood volume ratio with the increase
in diameter of logs as well as the decrease in sapwood volume ratio with
the rising log diameter.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
sar <- dat %>%
  group_by(dia_class) %>%
  summarise(N = n(), mean_dia = round(mean(dia_logm),2), mean_shr = round(mean(ratio_sw_hw),2), med = round(median(ratio_sw_hw),2), sd = round(sd(ratio_sw_hw),2))
colnames(sar) <- c("Diameter class", "Number of logs", "Mean diameter", "Mean ratio (sapwood to heartwood)", "Median ratio", "STDEV")
knitr::kable(sar, caption = "Ratio of sapwood to heartwood by the diameter class")
```

The above mentioned results is also justified by the table here. The
ratio of the sapwood to the heartwood ratio is decreasing with the
increasing diameter. Different ratios can be recommended for different
diameter if the ratio differs significantly.

\newpage

## Normality in ratio of sapwood to heartwood

The Shapiro-Wilk test assessed whether a ratio follows a normal
distribution by calculating a test statistic (W) and determining the
associated p-value. By comparing the p-value to a significance level,
you can determine whether the data can be considered normally
distributed or not.

```{r}
library(RcmdrMisc)
n_test <- normalityTest(dat$ratio_sw_hw)

n <- data.frame(Test_statistic= round(n_test$statistic,3), P.Value = n_test$p.value, Method = n_test$method)
colnames(n) <- c("Test_statistic", "P.Value", "Method")
knitr::kable(n, caption = "Result of normality test", align = 'c')
```

The Shapiro-Wilk normality test on a ratio, revealing a test statistic
(W) of 0.807 and a p-value of 0. In this case, the calculated test
statistic of 0.807 indicates that the data may deviate slightly from
perfect normality. However, the extremely small p-value of 0 suggests
strong evidence against the null hypothesis of normality. This implies
that the data is highly unlikely to have been generated from a normal
distribution. Therefore, based on the Shapiro-Wilk test results, we can
conclude that the data exhibits departures from normality.

## Variance in ratio of sapwood and heartwood.

Levene's test is robust to departures from normality and can be used
with unequal sample sizes.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, results= TRUE}
#install.packages("lawstat")
library(lawstat)
l <- levene.test(dat$ratio_sw_hw, dat$dia_class, 
            location = "median", correction.method = "zero.correction")
sl <- data.frame(Stat = round(l$statistic,2),P.Value = l$p.value, Method = l$method)

knitr:: kable(sl, caption = "Result of variance test", digits =  3, align = 'c')

```

The statistic value (3.55) represents the test statistic calculated by
the Levene's test. This test statistic is used to assess the difference
in variances between the different diameter classes. In this case, the
specific value of 3.55 is the computed test statistic of the sapwood
heartwood ratio.

The p-value (0.03) represents the probability of observing a test
statistic as extreme as the one calculated (or more extreme) under the
null hypothesis. In Levene's test, the null hypothesis is that the
variances of the heartwood sapwood ratios are equal across all the
diameter classes. A p-value of 0.03 indicates that if the null
hypothesis were true (i.e., if there were no difference in variances),
you would expect to observe a test statistic as extreme as 3.55 (or more
extreme) in only 3% of cases.

Since the p-value (0.03) is below the typical significance level of
0.05, the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence of a
significant difference in variances of the heartwood sapwood ratios
across the different diameter classes.

In summary, the results suggest that there is a significant difference
in the variances of the heartwood sapwood ratios between the diameter
classes based on the Levene's test.

## Choosing the statistical test

Our data did not possess the normality and does not have the equal
variance so that, non parametric test called Krushkal-Walis test is used
in the study.

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical test used to
determine if there are significant differences between the medians of
two or more independent groups. It is an extension of the Mann-Whitney U
test, which is used for comparing two groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test
ranks the observations from all groups, considering their joint
distribution, and calculates a test statistic based on the ranks. The
test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom
equal to the number of groups minus 1. By comparing the test statistic
to a critical value from the chi-square distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis
test assesses whether there are statistically significant differences in
medians among the groups. It is particularly useful when the assumptions
of normality and equal variances are violated, making it a robust
alternative for comparing groups based on medians.

```{r fig.cap="Distribution of ratio by diameter class", warning= FALSE, message=FALSE, results=TRUE}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = dat$ratio_sw_hw)) + 
    geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "dodge", col = "black") + 
    facet_wrap(~dia_class, ncol = 3) + 
    labs(x = "Ratio of sapwood to Heartwood", y = "Frequency")
```

As we discussed before the data is faraway from normality. The figure
shows the ratio of sapwood to the heartwood could be higher than 1 in
smaller logs i.e., volume of sapwood can be higher than that of
heartwood specially in smaller logs. The histogram demonstrates that the
data is not normally distributed and is skewed, with the means and
standard deviations of the different groups differing.

## Kruskal-Wallis Test Results

The Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted on the data, resulting in a test
statistic of 36.26329 and a p-value of 0. The test was performed using
the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, which is a non-parametric test used to
compare the medians of multiple independent groups. The Kruskal-Wallis
test statistic, which follows a chi-squared distribution, quantifies the
differences in ranks among the groups. In this case, the test statistic
value of 36.26329 indicates a substantial difference in ranks among the
groups. The p-value of 0 suggests that the observed test statistic is
statistically significant at conventional significance levels.
Therefore, there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that
the medians of the groups are equal. In summary, based on the results of
the Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 36.26329, p-value
= 0), we can conclude that there are significant differences in the
medians among the groups being compared.

```{r, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE, results= TRUE}
k <- kruskal.test(ratio_sw_hw ~ dia_class, data = dat)
r_k <- data.frame(Statistic = k$statistic, Parameter = k$parameter, P.Value = round(k$p.value,8), Method = k$method)
knitr::kable(r_k, caption = "Result from Kruskal-Wallis test", align = 'c')
```

```{r fig.cap="Box Plot of Ratio of sapwood to heartwood by diameter class", warning=FALSE, result = TRUE, message= FALSE}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x=dia_class, y=dat$ratio_sw_hw, group=dia_class)) + 
  geom_boxplot(col = 'black') +
  xlab("Diameter Class") +
  ylab("Ratio")
  
```

The dunn test as a post hoc analysis of kruskal-Walis test was performed
to identify the groups having difference in median.

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(dunn.test)
dunn_result <- dunn.test(dat$ratio_sw_hw, dat$dia_class, method = "bonferroni")
dunn_r <- data.frame(Dia_class = dunn_result$comparisons,Chi = dunn_result$chi2, z = dunn_result$Z, P = dunn_result$P, P.Adj = dunn_result$P.adjusted)
colnames(dunn_r)<- c("Diameter Class","Chi-squared Value", "Z- Value", "P.Value", "P.Adj")
knitr::kable(dunn_r, caption = "Result of dunn test (Post-HOC of Kruskal-Walis test)", digits =4 )
```

The dunn test preformed the post HOC analysis of non parametric test
i.e., kruskal walis test. The result illustrated the clear difference in
ratio of sapwood to the heartwood within different diameter class. The
table suggested that, there is no significant difference higher diameter
classes i.e.,30-50 and 50 above which might be because of small number
of samples in the highest class.

## Heartwood and Sapwood ratio in Terai and higher altitudes

The data is collected from five districts. Most of the sample log $n = 225$ is from Terai region i.e., Sindhuli marin, chitwan and Rapti divisional forest area from sindhuli, chitwan and makawanpur district respectively whereas the sample from middle hill region i.e., from kabhrepalanchok and dhading district is significantly less $n = 54$. Whereas it depends upon the habitat of *Acacia catechu* inside the district. The table donot reflect any significant difference in ratio between the log samples from Terai and Mid-hill Region. In addition to that the table shows high number of sample (see the difference in standard deviation of both groups and comparison with the number of samples in each) can decrease the deviation in the data which makes easier for decision makers.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dat_region <- dat %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    remarks %in% c("Rapti", "Chitwan", "sindhuli_marin") ~ "Terai",
    remarks %in% c("Kabhre", "Dhading") ~ "Mid-hill",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown" # Add a default value for any other remark not matched above
  ))

reg_tab <- dat_region %>%

# Conclusion

*Acacia catechu* named as *khair* in Nepal is a valuable economic
species which has great importance in national as well as local economy.
This study helps the forest manager, traders as well as local
users/plantation farmers to quantify the resource and valuate it in
terms of financial resources.

The study highlighted that the wood component ratio i.e., heartwood
volume to log volume, sapwood volume to log volume and ratio of sapwood
and heartwood volume are significantly different in different diameter
classes. The mean ratios for three diameter class of logs i.e, 0 - 30,
30 - 50, 50 above are 0.43, 0.28 and 0.11 respectively. Whereas median
ratio of those classes are 0.26, 0.14, 0.08 respectively. The diameter
and samples were not normally distributed and possess some outlier in
the distribution. In this case median data is highly recommended because
mean in highly sensitive to the distribution and outlier of the data. The ratio between the wood components do not possess the significant difference in Terai and Mid-hill regions.

The study concludes and recommend the median ratios as the findings to
use as a management tools. However, the study should be broaden with greater number of sample logs so that it will be easier for decision makers to imply it as management as well as financial tool.
